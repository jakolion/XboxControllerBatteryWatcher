## XboxControllerBatteryWatcher

Because of a missing battery level indicator on the Xbox One Controller when connected to a PC, XboxControllerBatteryWatcher is a tool for monitoring the battery level.
It shows a popup for a short time when the controller gets connected or disconnected or if the battery level changes. If the battery level changes to low or empty the popup will stay until it is clicked or the battery level changes again.
